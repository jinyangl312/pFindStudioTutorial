pLink 2
=================================

pLink is an engine for cross-link peptide identification, including peptides with chemical crosslinking, endogenous crosslinking and sumoylation.

The main form of peptide to be identified is inter-linked peptide. Besides, it also supports other forms, such as mono-linked peptides, loop-linked peptides and so on.

The current version is 2.3 which is ~40 times faster than pLink 1.
