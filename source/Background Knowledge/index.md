# Background Knowledge

For further knowledge about what is Computational Proteomics and how search engines identify MS/MS data, please refer to the first lecture of [CNCP系列公开课：《计算蛋白质组学》](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15A411c7jh?p=1) (in Chinese).

After watching the lecture, you may try to answer the following questions:

About definition:
- What is MS1 & MS2? How are they generated in a mass spectrometry?
- What is the definition of various fragment ions?
- How to interpret the text in .fasta file?

About search engine:
- What is the brief procedure for a search engine to identify MS/MS data?
- What is the purpose to introduce TDA-FDR method?
- How do open search different from restricted search?
