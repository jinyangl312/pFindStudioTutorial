# Background Knowledge

## Lecture
For further knowledge about what is Computational Proteomics and how search engines identify MS/MS data, please refer to the first lecture of [CNCP系列公开课：《计算蛋白质组学》](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV15A411c7jh?p=1) (in Chinese).

## Homework
After watching the lecture, you may try to answer the following questions:

### Definitions in mass spectrometry

What is the typical procedure for the identification of a protein sample?

What is MS-1 & MS-2 (MS/MS)? How are they generated in Liquid Chromatography Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (LC MS/MS)?

What is the definition of fragment ions abcxyz?

### Main ideas of pepide identification (database search approach)

What is the brief procedure for a protein database search engine to identify MS/MS data?

How to interpret the text in fasta file? How is fasta file turned into peptide candidates?

Given a sequence, how to label peaks in a MS/MS spectrum?

How to interfer the existence of a protein from peptides?

Why control False Discovery Rate (FDR)? How does Target-Decoy Approach (TDA) control FDR?

How does open search mode different from restricted search?
