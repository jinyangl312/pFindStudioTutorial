# Implementation Details
## Lecture
You can also watch the remant of the fifth lecture delivered by Zhenlin Chen to learn more technological details for the design of cross-linking database search engine.

## Homework
After watching it, you may try to answer the following questions:

What is the typical procedure for the preparation and identification of a cross-linked protein sample?

What is the brief procedure for a cross-linked protein database search engine to identify MS/MS data?

How does open search used in the identification of cross-linked peptides?

How is TDA-FDR transferred into cross-linked peptides?

How is fragment index used in the speed-up of pLink 2?

Why employing separate FDR for inter and intra cross-linked protein results?
