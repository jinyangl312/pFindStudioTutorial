### Main ideas of pepide identification (database search approach)

What is the brief procedure for a protein database search engine to identify MS/MS data?

How to interpret the text in fasta file? How is fasta file turned into peptide candidates?

> ![step_1](png/fasta.png)
Fasta file is consequently turned into peptide candidates by *in silico* splicing within search engines.

Why control False Discovery Rate (FDR)? How do Target-Decoy Approach (TDA) control FDR?

>![step_1](png/TDA.png)

How does open search mode different from restricted search in a user's view?

> Users do not need to restrict parameters such as splicing type and modifications.
